    "section": "1.1 What Is Remote Sensing",
    "text": "1.1 What Is Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing is the observation of the Earth from a distance using remote sensors on satellites or aircraft. Remote sensing provides a wealth of global perspectives and geographic information data(Earth Science Data Systems 2019).\nRemote sensing can be categorised according to the following elements.\n\n1.1.1 Earth Orbits\nThere are three types of Earth orbits: high Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, and low Earth orbit. Many weathers and some communication satellites tend to have high Earth orbits farthest from the surface(“Catalog of Earth Satellite Orbits” 2009). Satellites operating in medium (medium) Earth orbit include navigation satellites and specialised satellites designed to monitor specific areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne way of classifying orbits is by altitude. Source: earthobservatory.nasa\n\n\n\n\nThe altitude of the orbit, or the distance between the satellite and the Earth’s surface, determines how fast the satellite moves around the Earth. As satellites get closer to Earth, the pull of gravity becomes more muscular, and satellites move faster.\n\n\n1.1.2 Electromagnetic Spectrum\nThe electromagnetic spectrum ranges from shorter wavelengths to longer wavelengths. In most cases, the ultraviolet or ultraviolet portion of the spectrum has the shortest wavelength, which is helpful for remote sensing, and this radiation exceeds the violet part of the visible wavelength. Some earth’s surface materials, mainly rocks and minerals, fluoresce or emit visible light when exposed to ultraviolet light.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagram of the Electromagnetic Spectrum. Source: earthobservatory.nasa\n\n\n\n\nThe light that our eyes can detect is part of the visible spectrum. Much radiation around us is “invisible” to our eyes but can be seen by other remote sensing instruments and used in our research.\n\n\n1.1.3 Resolution\nResolution plays a vital role in how the data from the sensor is used. Resolution can vary depending on the satellite’s orbit and sensor design, and for any dataset, there are four types of resolution to consider: radiation, space, spectrum, and time.\nRadiation resolution is the sensitivity of a remote sensing platform to detect subtle differences in energy.\nSpatial resolution measures the minimum angular spacing between two objects.\nThe spectral resolution is the number and size of bands in the electromagnetic spectrum that a remote sensing platform can capture. For example, the first two Landsat satellites used a multispectral scanner (MSS) and captured images using four spectral bands.\nTemporal resolution refers to how often imagery is recorded for a particular area.\n\n\n1.1.4 Sensors\nAccording to the signal source of the exploration object, sensors can be divided into two types: active and passive. Active remote sensing instruments use their own emission sources, while passive remote sensing instruments operate on reflective or light sources.\nEach active sensor in remote sensing directs its signal to an object, then examines the response and accepts the data. Most devices use microwaves because they are relatively unaffected by weather conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagram of a passive sensor versus an active sensor. Source: earthobservatory.nasa\n\n\n\n\nUnlike active sensors, passive sensors do not streamline their energy to the object or surface being studied. Passive remote sensing relies on the natural energy (sunlight) reflected by the target. Therefore, it should only be used in proper sunlight. Otherwise, there will be nothing to remember."

    "text": "1.2 Remotely Data and Processing Methods\n\n1.2.1 Landsat Data and Sentinel Data\nLandsat and Sentinel sensors provide medium to high spatial resolution multispectral data for various applications. Through the synergistic use of Landsat and Sentinel data, it is expected to improve timely and accurate observations of the Earth’s surface and dynamics.\nLandsat is a scientific Earth observation mission of NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) that regularly captures images of the globe. Since its first launch in 1972, Landsat has collected data on forests, farmland, urban areas and freshwater, producing the longest continuous record of its kind. The Sentinel satellite is a European Space Agency (ESA) satellite designed to provide a large amount of data and images for Europe’s Copernicus program. Sentinel-1 has bipolar orbiting satellites to provide spatial data for environmental and security assurances and global economic and commercial growth.\n\n\n1.2.2 Processing Methods\nStandard processing methods for remote sensing data include the following:\nThe Tasseled-Cap transformation method converts remote sensing image data into three principal components to better describe the land cover type. The three main components are “brightness”, “greenness”, and “humidity”, which can be used to identify land use types and monitor vegetation growth status.\nThe Normalized Vegetation Index is a widely used index to measure vegetation cover. NDVI calculations are based on the ratio between infrared and visible bands and can be used to monitor vegetation growth, estimate vegetation productivity, and more.\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA): This method converts multiband remote sensing data into several principal components to characterise the land cover type better. This method can classify and monitor land use change, vegetation growth, etc.\n\n\n1.2.3 Applications\n\n\n1.2.4 Agriculture and Forestry\nIt can monitor vegetation cover, land-use change, drought and disasters, etc., to help crop production and forest management. Time series from the Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites have great potential for simulating vegetation seasonality(Jönsson et al. 2018).\n\n\n1.2.5 Water Management\nIt can monitor changes in water bodies, including water level, flow rate, water temperature, etc., which helps in water management and protection. Using multi-sensor data such as Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-1 SAR images as source data, a regional adaptive random forest algorithm can be constructed to realise automatic surface water mapping(Tang et al. 2022)."

In the future, multiple technologies, such as machine learning algorithms, can be employed to improve the quality and reliability of data.\n\n\n1.3.2 Real-time Information Detection Platform\nBased on remote sensing data, current affairs feedback the city. Urban planning is dynamic, and urban surface information needs constantly change. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a complete urban surface information monitoring system and a regular feedback mechanism to meet urban planning needs.\n\n\n1.3.3 Multi-source Data Integration\nUrban surface information involves multiple aspects, such as terrain, buildings, traffic, vegetation, etc., so multi-source data integration is required. Different data sources have other data formats and resolutions, and effectively integrating this data is challenging. In the future, more data fusion techniques can be adopted.\n\n\n\n\n“Catalog of Earth Satellite Orbits.” 2009. https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/OrbitsCatalog.\n\n\nEarth Science Data Systems, NASA. 2019. “What Is Remote Sensing?” https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/backgrounders/remote-sensing.\n\n\nJönsson, Per, Zhanzhang Cai, Eli Melaas, Mark A.

With a population of 5,570,585 (as of the 2011 census), Ahmedabad is India’s fifth most populous city. Ahmedabad has become an important economic and industrial hub in India.\n\n\n\n\n\nAhmedabad cityscape. Source: Wiki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Policy background\nWeather changes lead to an increase in average temperatures and a likelihood of severe heat waves. Extreme heat can lead to dangerous and fatal health consequences, including heat stress and heat stroke. Ahmedabad experienced an intense heat wave in May 2010, increasing 1,344 deaths registered in May. In 2013, AMC, with the help of national and international academic experts, drew on best practices in global early warning systems and high-temperature adaptation to develop its first High-Temperature Action Plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nAhmedabad community members, July 2011. Source: Ahmedabad 2016 Heat Action Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 The goal\nThe High-Temperature Action Plan aims to provide a framework for implementing, coordinating and evaluating extreme heat response activities in Ahmedabad to reduce the negative health impacts of extreme heat. The program’s primary goal is to alert those most at risk of heat-related illness that extreme heat conditions are imminent and to take appropriate precautions.\n\n\n4.1.4 Policy strategies\nThe strategy consists of the following four steps:\n\nBuild public awareness and community outreach to communicate the risks of heat waves and take steps to prevent heat-related deaths and diseases. Spread general information on protecting people from extreme heat through media channels and information materials, such as brochures and advertisements on heat stress prevention. As part of this year’s plan, new efforts include using modern media such as SMS, SMS, email, radio and mobile apps such as WhatsApp. Special efforts will be made to reach vulnerable groups through interpersonal communication and other outreach methods.\n\n\nActivate early warning systems and inter-agency coordination to alert residents to expected high temperatures and extremes. The U.S. Weather Center has established formal communication channels to disseminate forecasts of extreme temperatures to government agencies, weather centres, health officials and hospitals, emergency responders, local community groups, and the media.\n\n\nCapacity building of health care professionals to identify and respond to heat-related illnesses, especially during extreme heat events. This training focuses on primary and other paramedical personnel and community health workers so that they can effectively prevent and manage heat-related cases, thereby reducing mortality and morbidity.\n\n\nThrough new efforts, including mapping high-risk areas of cities, increased dissemination and communication of prevention methods, access to drinking water and cooling spaces on sweltering days, reduced heat exposure and promotion of adaptation measures. Cooperation with NGOs was also identified as a means of expanding outreach and communication with the city’s most at-risk communities.\n\n\n\n4.1.5 The effect of the implementation of the policy\nThis graph shows the relationship between heat waves and mortality. Initial evaluations of the 2013 and 2014 High Temperature Action Plans have shown positive results in reducing mortality during the year’s hottest months. During India’s historic heat wave in 2015, more than 2,300 people died nationwide, and Ahmedabad reported fewer than 20 heat-related deaths. Future responses must be based on understanding the action and evidence of its impact.\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature and all-cause mortality correlation during the 2010 heat wave.

Referring to related papers, remote sensing data can be used to obtain detailed region-specific spatial information on urban thermal vulnerability distribution, which is valuable for informed urban heat mitigation, planning and decision-making.\nUsing the biophysical surface properties and sociodemographic factors derived from Landsat-8, it is possible to analyse and explore the thermal situation and thermal vulnerability of different areas in the city, and the relevant conclusions can help urban governance. Studies have shown a strong spatial correlation between thermal susceptibility and observed surface temperature during the hot season. Surface temperature is a good indicator of thermal vulnerability in the region.\n\n\n4.2.3 Thermal vulnerability and land-use types\nBased on factors derived from biophysical indices and socio-demographic variables obtained from Landsat 8, areas of thermal vulnerability within cities can be predicted. The potential vulnerability of city dwellers to extreme heat is assessed based on the Thermal Vulnerability Index, which uses standardised indices of physical exposure to high temperatures (NDVI, NDBI and NDWI) and socio-demographic factors. With NDBI and NDVI for vulnerability mapping, NDWI for surface water content and detailed quantification of vegetation health were included. These indices were retrieved using data from the recently launched Landsat 8 mission, taking advantage of radiometry and spectral resolution improvements compared to earlier Landsat missions. It can be demonstrated that vulnerabilities vary widely in space. Thermal vulnerability maps drawn at 30-meter resolution improve spatial detail and are essential for area-specific interventions within cities.\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of (a) heat vulnerability and (b) land use and land cover (LULC) types in Harare. Source: Taylor\n\n\n\n\nAreas with high thermal vulnerability are also at increased risk, as these areas also record high surface temperatures. Thermal susceptibility is spatially correlated with temperature during hot seasons. High temperatures are observed in the south and west, with moderate to high thermal vulnerability. It has been observed that the temperature in the northeast of the city is low, mostly between 17 and 25°C; Thermal exposure is also mapped as low. Low temperatures and fragility are also observed in the southeasternmost region, where large bodies of water are located.\n\n\n\n\n\nMapped vulnerability of Harare to high surface temperatures (a) and its link to surface temperature observed on 30 October 2015 (b).

This step is often called preprocessing because it typically extracts information from the image for a specific application before the actual image analysis.\nA common barrier to using remotely sensed data for nature conservation is the difficulty of obtaining or generating pre-processed data to meet a standard of confidence in its subsequent use. This processing is essential to facilitate physical measurements (e.g., temperature, surface reflectance, altitude) and to compare data obtained from different dates or regions (e.g., reflectance or radar backscatter). For optical and radar data, this preprocessing includes atmospheric and topographic correction, orthorectification, and more, and for lidar, ground echo classification and surface height retrieval\n\n3.7.1 Geometric corrections\n\n3.7.1.1 Why do geometric corrections are needed?\nAll remotely sensed images of the Earth’s surface contain many geometric distortions. Distortion is inherent in the acquisition geometry, whether acquired by a multispectral scanner on a satellite, a photographic system on an aircraft, or any other platform/sensor combination, with various geometric distortions. This problem is inherent in remote sensing. These errors can be due to a variety of factors, including one or more of the following(Canada 2008):\n\nViewing angle of sensor optics\nThe movement of the scanning system\nMovement and (in)stability of the platform\nPlatform height, attitude and speed\nThe terrain is undulating\nThe curvature and rotation of the Earth\n\nThe sources of geometric distortion and positional errors vary from case to case but are inherent in remote sensing imagery. In most cases, we can eliminate or at least reduce these errors, but they must be considered in each case before attempting to make a measurement or extract more information.\n\n\n3.7.1.2 The methods of geometric corrections\nGeometric corrections are achieved in the following four steps:\n\nGet Ground Control Points (GCPs).\nBuild sensor models\nCoordinate transformation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinate Transformation.

Atmospheric correction aims to determine the true surface reflectance value (.) by eliminating atmospheric effects in satellite imagery.\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmospheric Effect on Remote Sensing Data. Source: Slide Share\n\n\n\n\nThe atmospheric effects in optical remote sensing are significant and complex, dramatically altering the spectral properties of the radiation reaching the remote sensor. The atmosphere absorbs and scatters various wavelengths of the visible spectrum that must pass through the atmosphere twice, once from the sun to the object and then propagate again when it returns to the image sensor. These distortions are corrected using a variety of methods and techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Atmospheric Correction a Landsat Image With Haze Effect Before Correction. Source: ResearchGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.3 Orthorectification correction\n\n3.7.3.1 What is Orthorectification correction？\nThe original satellite imagery contains distortion caused by sensor orientation, terrain changes, and Earth’s curvature. When collecting satellite imagery, it needs to be processed using orthorectification to correct for inaccuracies.\nDistortion occurs in feature displacement and causes scaling inconsistencies in the image. The distortion level changes throughout the imagery scene, meaning simple ground control point adjustments alone cannot compensate for these errors. The correction process for terrain changes and sensor orientation needs to be considered to rearrange displaced pixels to the correct position.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrthorectification Correction. Source: InterMap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.3.2 Accurate elevation models are key\nFeature distortion on the original imagery is greatly affected by terrain changes. An accurate elevation model is required to calculate the effect of terrain changes on imagery pixels. This calculation can then pinpoint the pixel to the correct location.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrtho Image. Source: InterMap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.4 Radiometric correction\nRadiation calibration is crucial for converting raw digital image data from satellite or aerial sensors to a standard physical scale based on known reflectance measurements obtained from ground objects. This type of correction is essential for reliable quantitative measures of images.\nImagery typically begins with an uncalibrated raw number (DN) of the pixel values in the imagery. These DN values are converted to radiance through a series of gains and offsets provided by the app data provider. The degree of radioactivity depends on the illumination (intensity and direction), the law and location of the target feature to be imaged, and the path of light through the atmosphere."
