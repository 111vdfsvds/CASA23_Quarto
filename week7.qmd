# Classification II

## Summary

### Landcover classification

#### Object based image analysis (OBIA)

Object-based image analysis (OBIA) involves first grouping pixels into objects based on spectral similarity or external variables such as ownership, soil, or geological units. Many variables can be identified and categorised into spectra, shapes, and neighbourhoods. Examples of spectral variables include mean and standard deviation for specific spectral bands; Shape variables include size, perimeter, and compactness; For example, a neighbourhood variable represents the mean difference between an object and a dark-coloured object. Each object is also part of a "super object", obtained by combining several adjacent objects into a larger one, each of which can be subdivided into smaller objects: "sub-objects".

#### Sub-pixel analysis

The sub-pixel analysis is a digital image processing technique that achieves subpixel resolution in images. This means that subpixel resolution can be obtained when the information of a picture exceeds its nominal pixel resolution. For example, in an idea, a position is represented as an integer value (x,y) coordinates and a place where a fractional pixel location might be given.

### Accuracy

#### Accuracy in remote sensing data

The accuracy assessment or verification of remote sensing data is an essential step in the remote sensing data processing. It determines the informational value of the resulting data to the user. Geographic data can only be effectively utilised when the data quality is known12. Accuracy assessment and validation are critical for remote sensing-based projects. Using unknown or less accurate data for decision-making or scientific analysis will result in low information reliability, error propagation effects, and limited value.

```

#### Balance the accuracy of the data

It cannot be achieved a high producer accuracy (recall) and a high user's accuracy (precision) simultaneously.

```

### Verification method

#### Divide the dataset

Typically, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance. This aims to prevent overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but not on the new data. By considering the model on an independent test set, we can better understand the model's ability to generalise to unknown data.

knitr::include_graphics('week7/Dividing the data set.jpg')
```

#### Cross validation

Cross Validation is a statistical method used to assess the generalisation ability of a model. It tests the model's performance on the other subsets by dividing the dataset into subsets and then training the model on one of the subsets. This process is repeated multiple times, training and testing with a different subgroup each time. Finally, the average of all test results is used to evaluate the model's performance. Cross-validation can help us better understand the model's generalisation ability for anonymous data and help select appropriate model parameters.

knitr::include_graphics('week7/cross validation.jpg')
```

#### Spatial Cross Validation

Spatial Cross Validation is a method for evaluating the performance of spatial prediction models. It is similar to normal cross-validation but considers spatial relationships when dividing the dataset. The dataset is divided into subsets in spatial cross-validation, each containing adjacent observations. Then, train the model on one subset and test the model's performance on the other subsets. This process is repeated multiple times, training and testing with a different subgroup each time. Spatial cross-validation can help us better understand the model's generalisation ability to unknown data and help select appropriate model parameters.

## Application

### Map land cover and land use from object-based classification

Whether object-based image analysis (OBIA) can improve land cover and land-use classification in complex agricultural landscapes located on the borders of Poland and Ukraine were tested. The results of OBIA-based land cover and land use classification based on OBIA and per pixel were quantitatively compared. The results show that when using the OBIA-based method, the OBIA-based process is significantly improved when the OBIA-based method is applied using both the spectra and spatial/geometric features of the image object, but not when the spectral or spatial/geometric features alone are used[@goodin2015]. In human-altered landscapes, the geometry and arrangement of surface spatial structures can convey land use information, and OBIA-based techniques can provide a powerful tool for improving classification.

```

The object-based approach involves two distinct steps: (1) segmentation (including object parameter calculation); (2) Classification. In object-based analysis, segmentation is a critical step.

### Fine-grained zoning mapping of land cover within river

Accurate mapping of land cover diversity in riparian areas at the regional scale is a significant challenge to better understanding the impact of riparian landscapes and associated natural and anthropogenic pressures on river ecological conditions. Since land cover (RALC) structures in riparian areas are often unavailable using medium-scale satellite imagery, finer spatial resolution imagery and specific mapping techniques are required[@tormos2012]. Develop a classification program based on a thorough multi-scale object-based image analysis (OBIA) scheme to generate detailed and reliable RARC maps in different geographical environments (geomorphology, climate and geology).

```

The OBIA scheme uses fuzzy expert knowledge classification rules to combine information from high spatial resolution multispectral images (satellite or airborne) with available space-thematic data. It was tested on the Hérault basin (southern France), which presents a contrasting landscape with a total length of 1,150 km of streams, using SPOT (Earth Observation System) 5 XS imagery (10 m pixels), aerial photography (0.5 m pixels) and several national space thematic data[@tormos2012].

## Reflection

In this week's course, I learnt about object-based graphical processing of remotely sensed data, assessing the accuracy of remotely sensed data and data validation methods. I also learnt how to determine the accuracy of remote sensing data and mastered data validation techniques. This knowledge will greatly help me in my future research and practical work.

Remote sensing data has many applications in urban planning, environmental protection and natural resource management. By studying this week's course, I can better apply remote sensing data to analyse and control cities. For example, remote sensing data can be used to conduct land use analysis and improve the efficiency of urban land use. Also, remote sensing data can be used for urban environmental protection and pollution monitoring.
