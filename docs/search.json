    "section": "1.1 What Is Remote Sensing",
    "text": "1.1 What Is Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing is the observation of the Earth from a distance using remote sensors on satellites or aircraft. Remote sensing provides a wealth of global perspectives and geographic information data(Earth Science Data Systems 2019).\nRemote sensing can be categorised according to the following elements.\n\n1.1.1 Earth Orbits\nThere are three types of Earth orbits: high Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, and low Earth orbit. Many weathers and some communication satellites tend to have high Earth orbits farthest from the surface(“Catalog of Earth Satellite Orbits” 2009). Satellites operating in medium (medium) Earth orbit include navigation satellites and specialised satellites designed to monitor specific areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne way of classifying orbits is by altitude. Source: earthobservatory.nasa\n\n\n\n\nThe altitude of the orbit, or the distance between the satellite and the Earth’s surface, determines how fast the satellite moves around the Earth. As satellites get closer to Earth, the pull of gravity becomes more muscular, and satellites move faster.\n\n\n1.1.2 Electromagnetic Spectrum\nThe electromagnetic spectrum ranges from shorter wavelengths to longer wavelengths. In most cases, the ultraviolet or ultraviolet portion of the spectrum has the shortest wavelength, which is helpful for remote sensing, and this radiation exceeds the violet part of the visible wavelength. Some earth’s surface materials, mainly rocks and minerals, fluoresce or emit visible light when exposed to ultraviolet light.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagram of the Electromagnetic Spectrum. Source: earthobservatory.nasa\n\n\n\n\nThe light that our eyes can detect is part of the visible spectrum. Much radiation around us is “invisible” to our eyes but can be seen by other remote sensing instruments and used in our research.\n\n\n1.1.3 Resolution\nResolution plays a vital role in how the data from the sensor is used. Resolution can vary depending on the satellite’s orbit and sensor design, and for any dataset, there are four types of resolution to consider: radiation, space, spectrum, and time.\nRadiation resolution is the sensitivity of a remote sensing platform to detect subtle differences in energy.\nSpatial resolution measures the minimum angular spacing between two objects.\nThe spectral resolution is the number and size of bands in the electromagnetic spectrum that a remote sensing platform can capture. For example, the first two Landsat satellites used a multispectral scanner (MSS) and captured images using four spectral bands.\nTemporal resolution refers to how often imagery is recorded for a particular area.\n\n\n1.1.4 Sensors\nAccording to the signal source of the exploration object, sensors can be divided into two types: active and passive. Active remote sensing instruments use their own emission sources, while passive remote sensing instruments operate on reflective or light sources.\nEach active sensor in remote sensing directs its signal to an object, then examines the response and accepts the data. Most devices use microwaves because they are relatively unaffected by weather conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagram of a passive sensor versus an active sensor. Source: earthobservatory.nasa\n\n\n\n\nUnlike active sensors, passive sensors do not streamline their energy to the object or surface being studied. Passive remote sensing relies on the natural energy (sunlight) reflected by the target. Therefore, it should only be used in proper sunlight. Otherwise, there will be nothing to remember."

Through the synergistic use of Landsat and Sentinel data, it is expected to improve timely and accurate observations of the Earth’s surface and dynamics.\nLandsat is a scientific Earth observation mission of NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) that regularly captures images of the globe. Since its first launch in 1972, Landsat has collected data on forests, farmland, urban areas and freshwater, producing the longest continuous record of its kind. The Sentinel satellite is a European Space Agency (ESA) satellite designed to provide a large amount of data and images for Europe’s Copernicus program. Sentinel-1 has bipolar orbiting satellites to provide spatial data for environmental and security assurances and global economic and commercial growth.\n\n\n1.2.2 Processing Methods\nStandard processing methods for remote sensing data include the following:\nThe Tasseled-Cap transformation method converts remote sensing image data into three principal components to better describe the land cover type. The three main components are “brightness”, “greenness”, and “humidity”, which can be used to identify land use types and monitor vegetation growth status.\nThe Normalized Vegetation Index is a widely used index to measure vegetation cover. NDVI calculations are based on the ratio between infrared and visible bands and can be used to monitor vegetation growth, estimate vegetation productivity, and more.\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA): This method converts multiband remote sensing data into several principal components to characterise the land cover type better. This method can classify and monitor land use change, vegetation growth, etc."

In the future, multiple technologies, such as machine learning algorithms, can be employed to improve the quality and reliability of data.\n\n\n1.3.2 Real-time Information Detection Platform\nBased on remote sensing data, current affairs feedback the city. Urban planning is dynamic, and urban surface information needs constantly change. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a complete urban surface information monitoring system and a regular feedback mechanism to meet urban planning needs.\n\n\n1.3.3 Multi-source Data Integration\nUrban surface information involves multiple aspects, such as terrain, buildings, traffic, vegetation, etc., so multi-source data integration is required. Different data sources have other data formats and resolutions, and effectively integrating this data is challenging.

    "text": "3.1 About the corrections\n\n3.1.1 Pre-processing requirements\nThe remote sensing data acquisition process is affected by several factors that can degrade the quality of the acquired images. This may affect the accuracy of image analysis. The purpose of image correction and restoration is to correct.\n\n\n3.1.2 Geometric corrections\n\n3.1.2.1 Why do geometric corrections are needed?\nAll remotely sensed images of the Earth’s surface contain many geometric distortions. Distortion is inherent in the acquisition geometry, whether acquired by a multispectral scanner on a satellite, a photographic system on an aircraft, or any other platform/sensor combination, with various geometric distortions. This problem is inherent in remote sensing. These errors can be due to a variety of factors, including one or more of the following(Canada 2008):\n\nViewing angle of sensor optics\nThe movement of the scanning system\nMovement and (in)stability of the platform\nPlatform height, attitude and speed\nThe terrain is undulating\nThe curvature and rotation of the Earth\n\nThe sources of geometric distortion and positional errors vary from case to case but are inherent in remote sensing imagery. In most cases, we can eliminate or at least reduce these errors, but they must be considered in each case before attempting to make a measurement or extract more information.\n\n\n3.1.2.2 The methods of geometric corrections\nGeometric corrections are achieved in the following four steps:\n\nGet Ground Control Points (GCPs).\nBuild sensor models\nCoordinate transformation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinate Transformation. Source: Wiki\n\n\n\n\n\nResampling of pixel values\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNearest Neighbor Resampling. Source: Wiki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Atmospheric corrections\nThe solar radiation reflected from the Earth’s surface to satellite sensors is altered by its interaction with the atmosphere. Atmospheric correction aims to determine the true surface reflectance value (.) by eliminating atmospheric effects in satellite imagery.\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmospheric Effect on Remote Sensing Data. Source: Slide Share\n\n\n\n\nThe atmospheric effects in optical remote sensing are significant and complex, dramatically altering the spectral properties of the radiation reaching the remote sensor. The atmosphere absorbs and scatters various wavelengths of the visible spectrum that must pass through the atmosphere twice, once from the sun to the object and then propagate again when it returns to the image sensor. These distortions are corrected using a variety of methods and techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Atmospheric Correction a Landsat Image With Haze Effect Before Correction. Source: ResearchGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Orthorectification correction\n\n3.1.4.1 What is Orthorectification correction？\nThe original satellite imagery contains distortion caused by sensor orientation, terrain changes, and Earth’s curvature. When collecting satellite imagery, it needs to be processed using orthorectification to correct for inaccuracies.\nDistortion occurs in feature displacement and causes scaling inconsistencies in the image. The distortion level changes throughout the imagery scene, meaning simple ground control point adjustments alone cannot compensate for these errors. The correction process for terrain changes and sensor orientation needs to be considered to rearrange displaced pixels to the correct position.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrthorectification Correction. Source: InterMap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4.2 Accurate elevation models are key\nFeature distortion on the original imagery is greatly affected by terrain changes. An accurate elevation model is required to calculate the effect of terrain changes on imagery pixels. This calculation can then pinpoint the pixel to the correct location.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrtho Image. Source: InterMap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Radiometric correction\nRadiation calibration is crucial for converting raw digital image data from satellite or aerial sensors to a standard physical scale based on known reflectance measurements obtained from ground objects. This type of correction is essential for reliable quantitative measures of images.\nImagery typically begins with an uncalibrated raw number (DN) of the pixel values in the imagery. These DN values are converted to radiance through a series of gains and offsets provided by the app data provider. The degree of radioactivity depends on the illumination (intensity and direction), the law and location of the target feature to be imaged, and the path of light through the atmosphere."

These are Surface Reflectance (SREF), Standardized Surface Reflectance (STDSREF), Sentinel-2 Atmospheric Correction (S2AC), Atmospheric Effects Image Correction (iCOR), Dark Object Subtraction (DOS), and Atmospheric Top (TOA) Reflectivity(Rumora, Miler, and Medak 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe workflow of processing Sentinel-2.

Combining vegetation indices from remote sensing imagery with other hydrometeorological data, it widely monitors natural disasters such as droughts. The most important task is to retrieve the actual value of the state of vegetation from satellite remote sensing data.\nTen Landsat TM/ETM+ images were used to test the effects of applying an atmospheric correction to retrieve accurate vegetation index and evapotranspiration(Hadjimitsis et al. 2010).

With a population of 5,570,585 (as of the 2011 census), Ahmedabad is India’s fifth most populous city, and Ahmedabad has become an important economic and industrial hub in India(“Ahmedabad” 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\nAhmedabad cityscape. Source: Wiki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Policy background\nWeather changes lead to an increase in average temperatures and a likelihood of severe heat waves. Extreme heat can lead to dangerous and fatal health consequences, including heat stress and heat stroke. Ahmedabad experienced an intense heat wave in May 2010, increasing 1,344 deaths registered in May. In 2013, AMC, with the help of national and international academic experts, drew on best practices in global early warning systems and high-temperature adaptation to develop its first High-Temperature Action Plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nAhmedabad community members, July 2011. Source: Ahmedabad 2016 Heat Action Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 The goal\nThe High-Temperature Action Plan aims to provide a framework for implementing, coordinating and evaluating extreme heat response activities in Ahmedabad to reduce the negative health impacts of extreme heat. The program’s primary goal is to alert those most at risk of heat-related illness that extreme heat conditions are imminent and to take appropriate precautions.\n\n\n4.1.4 Policy strategies\nThe strategy consists of the following four steps:\n\nBuild public awareness and community outreach to communicate the risks of heat waves and take steps to prevent heat-related deaths and diseases. Spread general information on protecting people from extreme heat through media channels and information materials, such as brochures and advertisements on heat stress prevention. As part of this year’s plan, new efforts include using modern media such as SMS, SMS, email, radio and mobile apps such as WhatsApp. Special efforts will be made to reach vulnerable groups through interpersonal communication and other outreach methods.\n\n\nActivate early warning systems and inter-agency coordination to alert residents to expected high temperatures and extremes. The U.S. Weather Center has established formal communication channels to disseminate forecasts of extreme temperatures to government agencies, weather centres, health officials and hospitals, emergency responders, local community groups, and the media.\n\n\nCapacity building of health care professionals to identify and respond to heat-related illnesses, especially during extreme heat events. This training focuses on primary and other paramedical personnel and community health workers so that they can effectively prevent and manage heat-related cases, thereby reducing mortality and morbidity.\n\n\nThrough new efforts, including mapping high-risk areas of cities, increased dissemination and communication of prevention methods, access to drinking water and cooling spaces on sweltering days, reduced heat exposure and promotion of adaptation measures. Cooperation with NGOs was also identified as a means of expanding outreach and communication with the city’s most at-risk communities.\n\n\n\n4.1.5 The effect of the implementation of the policy\nThis graph shows the relationship between heat waves and mortality. Initial evaluations of the 2013 and 2014 High Temperature Action Plans have shown positive results in reducing mortality during the year’s hottest months. During India’s historic heat wave in 2015, more than 2,300 people died nationwide, and Ahmedabad reported fewer than 20 heat-related deaths. Future responses must be based on understanding the action and evidence of its impact.\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature and all-cause mortality correlation during the 2010 heat wave.

Referring to related papers, remote sensing data can be used to obtain detailed region-specific spatial information on urban thermal vulnerability distribution, which is valuable for informed urban heat mitigation, planning and decision-making.\nUsing the biophysical surface properties and sociodemographic factors derived from Landsat-8, it is possible to analyse and explore the thermal situation and thermal vulnerability of different areas in the city, and the relevant conclusions can help urban governance. Studies have shown a strong spatial correlation between thermal susceptibility and observed surface temperature during the hot season(Mushore et al. 2018). Surface temperature is a good indicator of thermal vulnerability in the region.\n\n\n4.2.3 Thermal vulnerability and land-use types\nBased on factors derived from biophysical indices and socio-demographic variables obtained from Landsat 8, areas of thermal vulnerability within cities can be predicted. The potential vulnerability of city dwellers to extreme heat is assessed based on the Thermal Vulnerability Index, which uses standardised indices of physical exposure to high temperatures (NDVI, NDBI and NDWI) and socio-demographic factors. With NDBI and NDVI for vulnerability mapping, NDWI for surface water content and detailed quantification of vegetation health were included. These indices were retrieved using data from the recently launched Landsat 8 mission, taking advantage of radiometry and spectral resolution improvements compared to earlier Landsat missions. It can be demonstrated that vulnerabilities vary widely in space. Thermal vulnerability maps drawn at 30-meter resolution improve spatial detail and are essential for area-specific interventions within cities(Mushore et al. 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of (a) heat vulnerability and (b) land use and land cover (LULC) types in Harare.

This step is often called preprocessing because it typically extracts information from the image for a specific application before the actual image analysis.\nA common barrier to using remotely sensed data for nature conservation is the difficulty of obtaining or generating pre-processed data to meet a standard of confidence in its subsequent use. This processing is essential to facilitate physical measurements (e.g., temperature, surface reflectance, altitude) and to compare data obtained from different dates or regions (e.g., reflectance or radar backscatter). For optical and radar data, this preprocessing includes atmospheric and topographic correction, orthorectification, and more, and for lidar, ground echo classification and surface height retrieval\n\n3.6.1 Geometric corrections\n\n3.6.1.1 Why do geometric corrections are needed?\nAll remotely sensed images of the Earth’s surface contain many geometric distortions. Distortion is inherent in the acquisition geometry, whether acquired by a multispectral scanner on a satellite, a photographic system on an aircraft, or any other platform/sensor combination, with various geometric distortions. This problem is inherent in remote sensing. These errors can be due to a variety of factors, including one or more of the following(Canada 2008):\n\nViewing angle of sensor optics\nThe movement of the scanning system\nMovement and (in)stability of the platform\nPlatform height, attitude and speed\nThe terrain is undulating\nThe curvature and rotation of the Earth\n\nThe sources of geometric distortion and positional errors vary from case to case but are inherent in remote sensing imagery. In most cases, we can eliminate or at least reduce these errors, but they must be considered in each case before attempting to make a measurement or extract more information.\n\n\n3.6.1.2 The methods of geometric corrections\nGeometric corrections are achieved in the following four steps:\n\nGet Ground Control Points (GCPs).\nBuild sensor models\nCoordinate transformation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinate Transformation.

Source: Wiki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Atmospheric corrections\nThe solar radiation reflected from the Earth’s surface to satellite sensors is altered by its interaction with the atmosphere. Atmospheric correction aims to determine the true surface reflectance value (.) by eliminating atmospheric effects in satellite imagery.\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmospheric Effect on Remote Sensing Data. Source: Slide Share\n\n\n\n\nThe atmospheric effects in optical remote sensing are significant and complex, dramatically altering the spectral properties of the radiation reaching the remote sensor. The atmosphere absorbs and scatters various wavelengths of the visible spectrum that must pass through the atmosphere twice, once from the sun to the object and then propagate again when it returns to the image sensor. These distortions are corrected using a variety of methods and techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Atmospheric Correction a Landsat Image With Haze Effect Before Correction. Source: ResearchGate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.3 Orthorectification correction\n\n3.6.3.1 What is Orthorectification correction？\nThe original satellite imagery contains distortion caused by sensor orientation, terrain changes, and Earth’s curvature. When collecting satellite imagery, it needs to be processed using orthorectification to correct for inaccuracies.\nDistortion occurs in feature displacement and causes scaling inconsistencies in the image. The distortion level changes throughout the imagery scene, meaning simple ground control point adjustments alone cannot compensate for these errors. The correction process for terrain changes and sensor orientation needs to be considered to rearrange displaced pixels to the correct position.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrthorectification Correction. Source: InterMap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.3.2 Accurate elevation models are key\nFeature distortion on the original imagery is greatly affected by terrain changes. An accurate elevation model is required to calculate the effect of terrain changes on imagery pixels. This calculation can then pinpoint the pixel to the correct location.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrtho Image. Source: InterMap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.4 Radiometric correction\nRadiation calibration is crucial for converting raw digital image data from satellite or aerial sensors to a standard physical scale based on known reflectance measurements obtained from ground objects. This type of correction is essential for reliable quantitative measures of images.\nImagery typically begins with an uncalibrated raw number (DN) of the pixel values in the imagery. These DN values are converted to radiance through a series of gains and offsets provided by the app data provider. The degree of radioactivity depends on the illumination (intensity and direction), the law and location of the target feature to be imaged, and the path of light through the atmosphere."

However, nonlinear methods can perform better when the relationship between a set of predictors and response variables is highly nonlinear and complex. A classification and regression tree is a nonlinear method that uses a set of predictors to build a decision tree that predicts the values of the response variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision trees can be applied to many predictor variables.

The essence of overfitting is to extract some residual changes (i.e. noise) unknowingly. As an extreme example, if the number of parameters is equal to or greater than the number of observations, then the model can perfectly predict the training data simply by memorising the data completely.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverfitting Electoral Precedence. Source: XKCD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2.2 How to avoid overfitting?\nWhile using linear models helps us avoid overfitting, many real-world problems are nonlinear. In addition to understanding how to detect overfitting, it is essential to avoid overfitting altogether. Here are some techniques you can use to prevent overfitting:\n\nEarly Stop: Pauses training before the model starts learning noise in the model.\nTrain with more data: Expand the training set to include more data, providing opportunities to resolve the dominant relationship between input and output variables to improve the model’s accuracy.\nData augmentation: While it’s best to inject clean, relevant data into the training data, noisy data is sometimes added to make the model more stable.\nFeature selection: When building a model, choose to identify the essential features in the training data and eliminate irrelevant or redundant features.\nRegularisation: If overfitting occurs when the model is too complex, reducing the number of features makes sense.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Image classification\n\n6.1.3.1 What is image classification?\nImage classification is an important computer vision task integral to modern technology. It involves assigning labels or tags to the entire image, taken from a pre-existing database acquired by training the model. On the surface, the process is simple, but in reality, it involves analysing the individual pixels of an image before determining the appropriate label for the overall picture. As a final result, we can acquire a series of data for each corresponding image. We can continue to categorise and analyse the information on the label.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe process of Remote sensing image classification method based on SDAE.

This means that machine learning algorithms are used to analyse and cluster unlabeled datasets by discovering hidden patterns or groups of data without human intervention. With the help of suitable algorithms, specific features of the image are systematically identified at the image processing stage.\n\n\nSupervise classificationThe supervised image classification method uses the previous classification’s reference sample (ground fact) to train the classifier and subsequently classify the new unknown data. Therefore, managed classification techniques visually select training data samples in images and assign them to pre-selected categories, including vegetation, roads, water resources, and buildings. This is done to create statistical measures for the overall picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsupervised and unsupervised classification.

Many variables can be identified and categorised into spectra, shapes, and neighbourhoods. Examples of spectral variables include mean and standard deviation for specific spectral bands; Shape variables include size, perimeter, and compactness; For example, a neighbourhood variable represents the mean difference between an object and a dark-coloured object. Each object is also part of a “super object”, obtained by combining several adjacent objects into a larger one, each of which can be subdivided into smaller objects: “sub-objects”.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Euclidean distance in SLIC.

This means that subpixel resolution can be obtained when the information of a picture exceeds its nominal pixel resolution. For example, in an idea, a position is represented as an integer value (x,y) coordinates and a place where a fractional pixel location might be given.\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of true colour high spatial resolution data (a) and Landsat surface reflectance (b) highlighting the spatial detail captured by high-resolution imagery (c) and the same areas as observed by Landsat (d) for the subset East Beechboro used within this study.

It determines the informational value of the resulting data to the user. Geographic data can only be effectively utilised when the data quality is known12. Accuracy assessment and validation are critical for remote sensing-based projects. Using unknown or less accurate data for decision-making or scientific analysis will result in low information reliability, error propagation effects, and limited value.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy Dimensions in Remote Sensing.

The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to evaluate the model’s performance. This aims to prevent overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but not on the new data.

It tests the model’s performance on the other subsets by dividing the dataset into subsets and then training the model on one of the subsets. This process is repeated multiple times, training and testing with a different subgroup each time. Finally, the average of all test results is used to evaluate the model’s performance.

It is similar to normal cross-validation but considers spatial relationships when dividing the dataset. The dataset is divided into subsets in spatial cross-validation, each containing adjacent observations. Then, train the model on one subset and test the model’s performance on the other subsets. This process is repeated multiple times, training and testing with a different subgroup each time.

The results show that when using the OBIA-based method, the OBIA-based process is significantly improved when the OBIA-based method is applied using both the spectra and spatial/geometric features of the image object, but not when the spectral or spatial/geometric features alone are used(Goodin, Anibas, and Bezymennyi 2015).

This effect can be very noticeable. On average, city daytime temperatures tend to be 1-7°F higher. This difference persists until night when the temperature in the city is still 5°F warmer than in the surrounding area. Scientists refer to regions affected by these higher temperatures as urban heat islands.\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban Heat Island. Source: Bay Area Monitor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 What caused the urban heat island\nThere are many reasons for UHI. When houses, shops, and industrial buildings are built together, it can create a UHI. Building materials are often very good at thermal insulation or insulation. This insulation makes the area around the building warmer. As cities grow, new developments such as roads and buildings replace natural surfaces such as trees, ponds, and soil. This change in the local environment leads to a corresponding change in the local climate, as these natural surfaces help regulate the temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe causes of the Urban Heat Island effect. Source: Research Gate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 The impact of urban heat islands\nOverheating can have many adverse effects on people and the environment. Air quality suffers because sunlight and radiant heat can quickly turn car exhaust into smoke. According to the Environmental Protection Agency’s website, “Increased daytime temperatures, reduced nighttime cooling, and elevated levels of air pollution associated with urban heat islands can affect human health, resulting in general malaise, difficulty breathing, heat cramps and exhaustion, non-fatal heat stroke, and heat-related mortality.” In short, all this heat is not just uncomfortable; it’s dangerous.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeat islands can be deadly.

The new guide provides planners with proven options to help fantastic cities.

High temperatures and humidity can lead to severe illness and death every summer. In fact, in a typical year, more Americans die from heat waves than all other natural disasters combined, whether direct mortality from heat stress (hyperthermia, also known as heat stroke) or rising mortality from natural causes due to worsening other medical conditions.\n\n\n8.2.2 New York thermal vulnerability\nAbout 80 per cent of heat stroke sufferers in New York City are overcome by overheating conditions in their homes, as indoor temperatures in urban environments can be even higher than outdoor temperatures when air conditioning is unavailable or not in use.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeat vulnerability index.

As a result, the UHI effect will intensify, with global warming, urban sprawl and increased anthropogenic heat flux leading to more significant thermal gradients between urban centres and surrounding rural areas(Fujibe 2011). As a result, the effects of climate change on UHI have been extensively studied, and cooling energy consumption and heat-related mortality are generally thought to increase given the warmer temperatures within urban agglomerations during extreme heat events(Luber and McGeehin 2008). To address these issues, several strategies have been proposed to help mitigate the impact of UHI by lowering the overall temperature of urban environments, including ISG and ISR."

Otherwise, solar radiation incident on the surface is prevented from reaching the surface below. Additional cooling can be achieved when the transpiration of the leaves and evaporation of the growth medium dissipate the radiation absorbed by the vegetation. Surface cooling produced by evapotranspiration is usually less than surface cooling made by shadows; However, this process effectively reduces the ambient air temperature on a large scale.\n\n\nIncrease surface reflectance (ISR)/cooling system.Urban materials generally have darker colours and higher heat capacity than vegetation. Because of this, urban areas tend to absorb and store more incident solar energy than their surroundings.

In the future, as remote sensing technology develops, its potential for application in urban management will grow.\nAlthough remote sensing technology has essential applications in urban heat island detection and urban policy-making, there are some technical limitations. Firstly, the resolution of remote sensing technology could be improved, making it impossible to monitor small urban heat island phenomena accurately. Secondly, the complexity of acquiring and processing remote sensing data makes it costly to use remote sensing technology in practice, requiring specialist personnel to operate. In addition, some things could be improved in the acquisition and processing of remote sensing data, which may affect the accuracy of the data.
