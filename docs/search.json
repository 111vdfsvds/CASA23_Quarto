I graduated from Zhejiang University with a Bachelor’s degree in Urban and Rural Planning, and during my undergraduate studies, my main research area was quantitative research on transport development. My current research interests are focused on two aspects: on the one hand, how to introduce more precise and intelligent research methods in urban research, and on the other hand, focusing on the development differences between cities and urban-rural areas to explore the regional and modal differences in spatial development."
