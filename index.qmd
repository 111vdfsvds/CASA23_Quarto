## About the book

This book summarises my thoughts and reflections on the CASA0023 'Remote Sensing Cities and the Environment' course. I took the course as part of my MSc in Urban Spatial Science at University College London. I look forward to receiving your valuable comments on this book.

## About me

Hello, my name is Zhiwei Huang or Morgan, and I am from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, a wonderful place in China. I graduated from Zhejiang University with a Bachelor's degree in Urban and Rural Planning, and during my undergraduate studies, my main research area was quantitative research on transport development. My current research interests are focused on two aspects: on the one hand, how to introduce more precise and intelligent research methods in urban research, and on the other hand, focusing on the development differences between cities and urban-rural areas to explore the regional and modal differences in spatial development.
